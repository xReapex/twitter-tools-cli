# Useful tools for Twitter!

You will need to generate a "bearer token" to give access to your account, find how [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens).

This token will be request by the application, you can also put it in the config file (**Recommended**)

# Using A Config File
Config file can be use from nowhere and must be specified when asked in the console.

``Config file must be a .json file, there is an example:``

```
{
  "bearer_token": "<your_token>"
}
```
